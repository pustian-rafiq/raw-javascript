    //varaible var
    //Variables, declared with var, are either function-scoped or global-scoped. They are visible through blocks.
   if (true) {
        var test = true; // use "var" instead of "let"
        }

        alert(test); // true, the variable lives after if because var work outside the block.it's global variable



    /*
    //let
    If we used let test instead of var test, then the variable would only be visible inside if:
    */
    if (true) {
         let test = true; 
      }

       alert(test); // Error: test is not defined because let doesn't work outside the block.It's not global


    
     //If a code block is inside a function, then var becomes a function-level variable:
    //for example
    function sayHi() {
        if (true) {
            var phrase = "Hello";
        }

        alert(phrase); // works
        }

        sayHi();
        alert(phrase); // Error: phrase is not defined 
   //var” tolerates redeclarations
   //If we declare the same variable with let twice in the same scope, that’s an error:
        let user;
        let user; // SyntaxError: 'user' has already been declared
    //With var, we can redeclare a variable any number of times. If we use var with an already-declared variable, it’s just ignored:    
            var user = "Pete";

            var user = "John"; // this "var" does nothing (already declared)
        // ...it doesn't trigger an error

        alert(user); // John


        //“var” variables can be declared below their use
        //In other words, var variables are defined from the beginning of the function, 
        //no matter where the definition is (assuming that the definition is not in the nested function).
        function sayHi() {
            phrase = "Hello";

            alert(phrase);

            var phrase;
            }
            sayHi();
